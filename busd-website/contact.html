                Hello! I am Bus-D Designs. Currently I am a graphic design student in college. I am just starting to get my freelancing career going to help me gain experience and also to help pay for college. I am grateful that you made it to my website! I hope that you have enjoyed what you have seen so far and that you consider having me do some work for you!<br><br>
                As you can see from the pieces of work I have throughout my website, I have had the opportunity to make different designs in different styles of work. If you are in need of something that isn't shown, theres a chance I have still done work in it. As I continue to create different designs I will keep posting them here.<br><br>
                My main emphasis in my studies is User Interface/Experience. I am also studying coding to go along with this, so this entire website was created by me! I know for some that isn't too great of a feat, but as it's my first website that I've built from the ground up, I'm pretty proud of it!
