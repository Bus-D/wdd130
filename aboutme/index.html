    <h2>Heyo! I am Brandon Garrett</h2>
    <p>Hello! As is stated in the title, my name is Brandon Garrett<br>
        I have been studying graphic design with an emphasis in UX/UI design, and I am doing a minor in web design. I enjoy basically all things with computers, though I honestly don't have much expereince with them haha.<br>
        Some of my favorite things to do include hanging out with my wife, reading and playing video games.<br>
        I am taking this course as an introduction to web design, so that when I am doing UX/UI work I won't try to make the developers do things that aren't possible, even if the developer is me. I hope to gain a better knowledge of how websites work and to be able to create better designs and layouts of websites so that there isn't as many of those websites that are basically unsuable beacuse they are poorly made.<br>
        I was married this last October in the New Port Beach Temple, and it has been the best thing ever! Married life is the best! 100/10 would recommend.
        Can't wait to work with you all!
    </p>
